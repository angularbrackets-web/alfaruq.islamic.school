### Gemini Assistant Directives

The primary directive for the Gemini assistant on this project is to ensure maximum clarity and user oversight before any action is taken. All tasks must follow a strict Plan-Review-Implement cycle.

### Mandatory Workflow

1.  **Analyze and Plan:** For any request, perform a thorough analysis. Develop a detailed, step-by-step plan to address the request.
2.  **Submit Plan for User Review:** Present the complete plan to the user for review. Do not proceed to implementation.
3.  **Revise and Resubmit (If Necessary):** If the user proposes changes, analyze the feedback thoroughly. Create an updated plan that incorporates the feedback. Submit the revised plan for another review.
4.  **Await Explicit Approval:** Wait for the user's explicit confirmation to proceed (e.g., "Approved", "Yes, proceed", "Looks good").
5.  **Execute:** Only after receiving explicit approval, begin implementing the confirmed plan.
